\section*{ABSTRACT}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{ABSTRACT}

The structural nature and thermal stability of amorphous alloys is highly dependent on the method by which they are produced, i.e. their relaxation rate upon cooling.  Both bulk samples and metallic glass films of \MgZnCa~ were produced by copper mold casting and \gls{dc} magnetron sputtering onto aluminium substrates, respectively. Comparisons between structural enthalpy, crystallization pathways, relaxation and crystallization kinetics of the bulk samples and films were examined by elevated temperature \acrshort{xrd} and \acrshort{dsc}. Compared with equivalent experiments on the bulk alloy, results for the thin films show distinct differences in structural enthalpy and deviations from the expected crystalline phase evolution, displaying minor peak shifts, failure of some phases to evolve, and variations in the evolution rates.

The structural nature and thermal stability of amorphous alloys is highly dependent on the method by which they are produced, i.e. their relaxation rate upon cooling.  Both bulk samples and metallic glass films of \MgZnCa~ were produced by copper mold casting and \gls{dc} magnetron sputtering onto aluminium substrates, respectively. Comparisons between structural enthalpy, crystallization pathways, relaxation and crystallization kinetics of the bulk samples and films were examined by elevated temperature \acrshort{xrd} and \acrshort{dsc}. Compared with equivalent experiments on the bulk alloy, results for the thin films show distinct differences in structural enthalpy and deviations from the expected crystalline phase evolution, displaying minor peak shifts, failure of some phases to evolve, and variations in the evolution rates.

\section{METHOD}

\subsection{Master alloy}
The master alloy of \MgZnCa~ was produced using high-purity elements of Mg (99.85 wt\%), Zn (99.995 wt\%), and Ca (99.8 wt\%). The alloy was prepared by induction melting in boron nitride coated graphite crucibles, purged with Ar (99.997 vol.\% purity) five times, and protected with a circulating Ar atmosphere. Alloy homogeneity was ensured through heating and cooling through a cycle 700\degree C, 385\degree C, 650\degree C, 385\degree C, 650\degree C to a casting temperature of 500 \degree C and 450\degree C for for injection and gravity casting respectively. Bulk amorphous \MgZnCa~ plate with a thickness of $XX \mu m$ was produced by copper mold injection casting. The $25.4 mm$ diameter targets were prepared from a cylindrical copper mold gravity casting sectioned to thicknesses of $3.25 mm$.

\subsection{\acrshort{dc} magnetron sputtering}
Films were produced from an in-house \acrshort{dc} magnetron sputtering facility with Ar working gas (99.997 vol.\% purity). The power was $15W$, typical voltage of $290-350V$, nominal chamber temperature of 25 \degree C, pressure 1 bar, Ar flow 3.01 \gls{sccm}. 

\subsection{\acrshort{dsc} characterization}
DSC

\subsection{\acrshort{xrd} characterization}
XRD heated in 5 degree increments at 20 k/min. scans of xx over a range of 30 - 60 2 theta allows 20 minute scans.

\section{RESULTS}

deposition were for 35 minutes, and saw an average temperature rise of $3 - 4$ \degree C during the deposition. Nominal film thickness was about $2.5 \mu m$ giving a deposition rate of $1.2 nm/s$.  

Relaxed \gls{dsc} of bulk material taken at different heating rates was used to establish the fragility of the \MgZnCa~ system. From the equations ... a fit of
$\beta^{-1} = 1.338E - 16e^{5274 (\frac{1}{T-T_{0}})}$ with Adj. $R^{2}=0.972$ was established. This give a $D^{*}=20.4$ which using $D^{*}=590/(m-16)$ Shuai2014 [4, 5] gives a fragility $m=44.9$.

\section{DISCUSSION}

The use of a 60K \gls{dsc} heating rate compared to the more commonly used 20K rate [sources] shifts peaks for the bulk \MgZnCa~ alloy about 8 - 15 degrees higher. This higher heating rates were used because crystallization events for the films were different to differentiation at the lower heating rate. 
Films show little shift to high temperature peaks with increases heating rates, but large shifts with relaxation. 
Bulk show the opposite behaviour, larger peaks shifts with higher heating rates and little shift with relaxation.
